> Get a recommended version bump based on conventional commits

Got the idea from https://github.com/conventional-changelog/conventional-changelog/pull/29


## Install

```sh
$ npm install --save conventional-recommended-bump
```


## Usage

```js
var conventionalRecommendedBump = require('conventional-recommended-bump');

conventionalRecommendedBump({
  preset: 'angular'
}, function(err, result) {
  console.log(result.releaseType);
  //=> 'major'
});
```

```sh
$ npm install --global conventional-recommended-bump
$ conventional-recommended-bump --help
```


## API

### conventionalRecommendedBump(options, [parserOpts], [callback])

#### options

##### ignoreReverted

Type: `boolean` Default: `true`

If `true`, reverted commits will be ignored.

##### preset

Type: `string` Possible values: `'angular'`

It's recommended to use a preset so you don't have to define everything yourself. Presets are names of built-in `config`.

##### config

Type: `object`

This should serve as default values for other arguments of `conventionalRecommendedBump` so you don't need to rewrite the same or similar config across your projects. Any value in this could be overwritten.

**NOTE:** `options.config` will be overwritten by the values of preset. You should use either `preset` or `config`, but not both.

##### whatBump

Type: `function`

A function that takes parsed commits as argument.

This should return an object including but not limited to `level` and `reason`. `level` is a `number` indicating what bump it should be and `reason` is the reason of such release.

For backward compatibility, it could return a `number` indicating what bump it should be.

###### whatBump(commits)

####### commits

Type: `array`

An array of parsed commits. The commits are from last semver tag to `HEAD` and is parsed by [conventional-commits-parser](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/conventional-commits-parser).

If it returns with `level` `0` it will be a `major` bump. If `1`, `minor` bump. If `2`, `patch`.

##### tagPrefix

Type: `string`

Specify a prefix for the git tag that will be taken into account during the comparison.

For instance if your version tag is prefixed by `version/` instead of `v` you would specify `--tagPrefix=version/`


#### parserOpts

See the [conventional-commits-parser](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/conventional-commits-parser) docs.

#### callback

Type: `function`

##### callback(error, object)

###### object

Object includes what's returned by `whatBump` and

####### releaseType

Type: `string` Possible values: `'major'`, `'minor'` and `'patch'`

The value of what it should release as.
