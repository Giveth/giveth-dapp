    reading the log line by line as a stream. (@rudolfix / Neufund contribution)

0.2.5 / 2017-10-02

    events are injected.

    Note: This change exposes the fact that a number of cases aren't actually being checked in the
    parse table. Possible test-deficits / parse-table logic defects here.
