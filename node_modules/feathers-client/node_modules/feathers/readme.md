Feathers is a real-time, micro-service web framework for NodeJS that gives you control over your data via RESTful resources, sockets and flexible plug-ins.

## Getting started

You can build your first real-time and REST API in just 4 commands:

```bash
$ npm install -g feathers-cli
$ mkdir my-new-app
$ cd my-new-app/
$ feathers generate
$ npm start
```

To learn more about Feathers visit the website at [feathersjs.com](http://feathersjs.com) or jump right into [the Feathers docs](http://docs.feathersjs.com).

## See it in action

Here is all the code you need to create a RESTful, real-time message API that uses an in-memory data store:

```js
// app.js
const feathers = require('feathers');
const rest = require('feathers-rest');
const socketio = require('feathers-socketio');
const memory = require('feathers-memory');
const bodyParser = require('body-parser');
const handler = require('feathers-errors/handler');

// A Feathers app is the same as an Express app
const app = feathers();

// Add REST API support
app.configure(rest());
// Configure Socket.io real-time APIs
app.configure(socketio());
// Parse HTTP JSON bodies
app.use(bodyParser.json());
// Parse URL-encoded params
app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({ extended: true }));
// Register our memory "messages" service
app.use('/messages', memory());
// Register a nicer error handler than the default Express one
app.use(handler());
// Start the server
app.listen(3000);
```

Then run

```
npm install feathers feathers-rest feathers-socketio feathers-errors feathers-memory body-parser
node app
```

and go to [http://localhost:3000/messages](http://localhost:3000/messages). That's it! There's a lot more you can do with Feathers including; using a real database, authentication, authorization, clustering and more! Head on over to [the Feathers docs](http://docs.feathersjs.com) to see just how easy it is to build scalable real-time apps.

## Documentation

The [Feathers docs](http://docs.feathersjs.com) are loaded with awesome stuff and tell you every thing you need to know about using and configuring Feathers.

## Examples

Each plugin has it's own minimal example in the repo. To see a more complex example go to [feathersjs/feathers-chat](https://github.com/feathersjs/feathers-chat).

## Security

We :heart: the community and take security very seriously. No one wants their app hacked. If you have come across a security concern please [report it responsibly](https://docs.feathersjs.com/security#where-should-i-report-security-issues). Visit the [Security section](https://docs.feathersjs.com/SECURITY.html) of the docs to learn more about how you can make sure your app is secure.

## Long Term Support Schedule

We are going to be following along with the Node.js long term support cycle. As a result **we have dropped official support for node v0.10, v0.12, and iojs versions**. Feathers still works on those versions but we're not going to ensure it will going forward.

We will be supporting Node.js v4 until **2018-04-01**.
We will be supporting Node.js v6 until **2019-04-18**.
