# localForage Docs #

localForage is a handy JavaScript library that improves the offline experience
of your web app by using asynchronous storage (via IndexedDB or WebSQL where
available) but with a simple, `localStorage`-like API.

These are the API docs for
[localForage](http://localForage.github.io/localForage). You can browse the
code in the [master branch](https://github.com/localForage/localForage).
