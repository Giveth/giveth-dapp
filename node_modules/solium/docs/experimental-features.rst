Experimental Features
#####################

At any given time, Solium might have a few experimental features in production. They're experimental in order to determine whether and to what extent they're beneficial. And we could really use your feedback on experimental features!

These features haven't been mentioned anywhere in the developer and user guides to ensure that you're aware when you're using an experimental feature in your workflow.

Only this section contains the list of the features. They are subject to change or even removal in subsequent releases. You can either use them temporarily or freeze the Solium version in your app to ensure thay always work for you (not recommended).

As a rule of thumb, **never use the features listed in this section in your production apps**.
