# Solparse

Pegjs-based Parser for the Solidity Programming language.

It was originally a fork of [Consensys' solidity-parser](https://github.com/ConsenSys/solidity-parser) by Tim Coulter. @cgewecke, @duaraghav8 and @federicobond are co-authors.

## Note
Solparse is primarily meant for [Solium](https://github.com/duaraghav8/Solium). Because its sole purpose is to make life easier for the linter, we do not guarantee that there won't be any breaking changes, although we work hard to keep it friendly.

If you use solparse in your production systems, use it as a fixed dependency, i.e., stick to a fixed version of the parser.
