# Components

**Note:** Docs are in-progress. Have a look at the [examples](https://github.com/twisty/formsy-react-components/tree/master/examples) to see how things work.

The components included are:

* `<Checkbox>`
* `<CheckboxGroup>`
* [`<File>`](file.md)
* `<Input>`
* `<RadioGroup>`
* `<Select>`
* `<Textarea>`

---

For convenience, we also ship a `<Form>` component that wraps `formsy-react`â€™s `<Form>` component and allows you to define some common props that will be picked-up by child components in the form.
