# Contributing
When bringing people on as contributors we prefer that they start with an issue tagged [good first issue](https://github.com/Giveth/giveth-dapp/labels/good%20first%20issue). After a contributor has shown they're a good fit and have completed 1 or 2 issues labeled [good first issue](https://github.com/Giveth/giveth-dapp/labels/good%20first%20issue) with pull requests that have been accepted feel free of moving on to other issues. We're always thrilled to see new contributors. Once an open source contributor has completed an issue labeled [good first issue](https://github.com/Giveth/giveth-dapp/labels/good%20first%20issue) or [help wanted](https://github.com/Giveth/giveth-dapp/labels/help%20wanted) they are eligible to apply for and receive reward DAO funds.

If you want to better understand how does the development process works, please refer to our [wiki pages](https://wiki.giveth.io/documentation/DApp), especially to the [Product Definition](https://wiki.giveth.io/documentation/DApp/product-definition/), [Product Roadmap](https://wiki.giveth.io/documentation/DApp/product-roadmap/) and [Development Process & Quality Assurance](https://wiki.giveth.io/documentation/DApp/product-development-testing/).

## Setup
In order to get the repositories setup before contributions refer to the [README.md](./README.md) file.

## Contribution Steps

1. *Find a suitable issue*

    If this is your first time look for an issue labeled [good first issue](https://github.com/Giveth/giveth-dapp/labels/good%20first%20issue) otherwise look for issues labeled [help wanted](https://github.com/Giveth/giveth-dapp/labels/help%20wanted). If another issue jumps out at you please engage on the issue before starting it.

2. *Assign yourself the issue*

    Let us know you're working on it! We hate wasted labour so it's always helpful to know what our community contributors are working on.

3. *Fork and clone giveth-dapp*

    In general it's a good practice to fork into your own repository. We prefer if issues
    are addressed in a branch with the issue number in it's name.
    i.e. `29_this_is_an_issue`

4. *Make contributions*

    Make all the changes needed to address the given issue.

5. *Add testing*

    In general we aim for full test coverage. For this reason most issues completed should include full testing. If you think there should be an exception for your issue please reach out. Don't forget to test the relevant part of the DApp manually.

6. *Run previous tests*

    Make sure that the changes that you've made don't break anything! Ensure that running `npm test` and `npm eslint` doesn't throw any new and unexpected errors.

7. *Push all your work*

    At this point the issue should be addressed, new testing should be in place, and all old tests should be passing.

8. *Create a Pull Request*

    At this point you should either have a forked repository with your issue fixes and it is time to put in a PR. Make sure that your PR has something like `addresses #26` or `closes #26` The most important thing is that it has the relevant issue number referenced in the body of the PR.

9. *Make noise!*

    Get in our slack and point to your new PR. Let us know you've tackled your first, third or 90th issue with us. We'll review it and everybody will get a warm feeling of accomplishment.

10. *rinse, repeat*

    Find another issue, get more involved, make noise in our slack, or find issues we may have missed. You've completed your first step to becoming a contributor. **You've helped to create the future of giving**!


If you still have any further questions about contribution feel free to reach out to `@vojtech`, `@perissology`, `@satya`, `@quazia`, or just make noise in the `#DApp Development` channel on [Riot](https://join.giveth.io).
