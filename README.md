# Install
`npm install`

# Start
`npm start`

# Build
`npm run build`

# Issues?
- You need to use Node > v6
- Don't use NPM? All commands can be used using Yarn.
- Don't like port 3010? Change it in `.env`

## Dependencies
- Bootstrap 4 (via CDN)
- Font Awesome (via CDN)
- Sass

All dependencies can be found in package.json, however here are the most important ones:
- React Router

## Where are the config files?
This project is setup using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). It can do almost everything (config via package.json) and best, it just works! :-)
If required you can 'eject' the project by running `npm run eject`. Note that there's no way back!
