# Install
`npm install`

# Start
`npm start`

# Build
`npm run build`

# Issues?
- You need to use Node > v6
- Don't use NPM? All commands can be used using Yarn.
- Don't like port 3010? Change it in `.env`

## Dependencies
- Bootstrap 4 (loaded via CDN)
- Sass
- React Router

## Where are the config files?
This project is setup using Create React App. It just works :-)
If required, this project can be 'ejected' by running `npm run eject`. Note that there's no way back!
